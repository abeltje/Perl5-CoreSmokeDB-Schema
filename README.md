# NAME

Perl5::CoreSmokeDB::Schema - [DBIC::Schema](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::Schema) for the smoke reports database

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Perl5::CoreSmokeDB::Schema;
my $schema = Perl5::CoreSmokeDB::Schema->connect($dsn, $user, $pswd, $options);

my $report = $schema->resultset('Report')->find({ id => 1 });
```
# DESCRIPTION

This class is used in the backend for accessing the database.

Another use is: `$schema->deploy()`

# SCHEMA

This ORM is generated by
[DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader)
and the `dbicdump` tool it provides (also see
[dbicdump.conf](support/dbicdump.conf)).

Central to the schema are `report`s, they have `config`s. Each `config` has `result`s, and each `result` may have `failures_for_env` that point to a `failure`.

## SmokeConfig

At the moment this table is not actively used (as the data is not propagated by
[Test::Smoke](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Smoke)), but each `report` belongs
to a `smoke_config`.

## Report

This table holds the basic information for a Perl5 core smoke report that is consistent throughout the smoke-run (like OS, hardware, source-tree status and agregate information).

## Config

A `config` consists the arguments passed to `./Configure` the name and version
of the c-compiler.

## Result

This is the aggregate information of a single `make test` run, recording the
value of the `PERLIO` environment variable the summary (`P`/`F`) and the timing
aggregates.

## FailuresForEnv

This is an intermediate table to normalise the many-to-many relationship
between a `result` and a test-`failure`.

## Failure

This table holds the test name, status and output from the test harness.

## TsgatewayConfig

This table (`tsgateway_config`) holds the schema version of the database and
was only introduced after the first version of the schema. It might also be
used future to keep other global information about the `Perl5::CoreSmokeDB`
software.
